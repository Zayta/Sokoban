tr: Mom, who are those girls at the doorway?
mom: Taria... You, I, and Dr.Kim are the only ones here.
dr: Mam, after some analysis on our previous encounters, I think your daughter might be schitzophrenic.
mom: No way...
tr: No! I'm not.
tr: Actually I was just kidding this entire time, I can't see any girls.
mom: Taria, if you have a condition, you should get it treated.
tr: No, I don't. I just wanted attention, because I get really bored in my room.
tr: My brothers don't talk to me, and so I am lonely.
tr: I wanted friends so badly that I imagined them.
mom: Oh, honey... I'm glad that's cleared up.
mom: Sorry for making you come all the way here Dr. Kim.
dr: No problem, Mam. I would be happy to help you whenever you need.
dr: Ten-year-olds these days do anything for entertainment.
mom: Taria. You shouldn't lie like that for months. You had me so worried.
tr: Mom, when I grow up, I want to go travel with friends.
mom: Maybe in the future.

I decided to keep the fact that I see ghosts a secret.
