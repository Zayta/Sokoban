intro:
Every person has a spiritual ghost.
When we sleep, our ghost comes out to protect our unconscious body.
From monsters like pride, wrath, envy, and sins that attack us.
If our spirit successfully defended all attacks,
We wake up mentally healthy.
However, rarely does this happen.

When people wake after being attacked,
They give birth to new monsters
Who invade others in their sleep.


NUR is an organization for fighting these monsters.
It consists of Nighters- victims who died mysteriously but were granted a second chance at life.
When Nighters sleep, their ghost goes to fight newborn monsters.
They surround a human
And slay every monster that comes out.


Policies:
Nighters must:
    Complete every assigned mission
    Not harm other Nighters.
    Eliminate humans who know of ghosts' existence
    Kill Wielders - defected Nighters who broke rules

If somehow a human can see the ghost,
And knows the ghost in real life,
The human can kill the ghost by calling out his/her name.
