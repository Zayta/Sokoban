intro:
lt: Taria is dying. We need to save her.
tyu: Can we find another way? Cybertization isn't safe and none of us performed it before.
lt: We have to try no matter what. We are ghosts so we can't ask humans for help.
lt: And we can't ask other ghosts because they want her dead.
tyu: I guess we are on our own...
tyu: We should study how Taria gave memories to Theta and use the same strategies.
lt: But that robot has fake memories. We need to transfer Taria's real memories...
lt: Actually it's a good idea. Let's practice installing a memory into Theta before we operate on Taria.
tyu: For the first round, do you want me to virtualize, and you monitor?
lt: Sure.

label exp1:
theta: Robot Theta activated. My birthday is February 30th, 2100.
theta: My best friend is Taria. My worst enemy is Argon.
theta: I need to avoid ghosts besides Letra, Tenyu and Lorale.
tyu: We did it!
lt: Yes! He remembers the basics.
tyu: We should try one more.

label exp2:
theta: *Points to Letra*
theta: You are Lorale.
theta: *Points to Tenyu*
theta: And you are Tenyu.
lt: ... I don't look like Lorale. I'm not even a guy.
tyu: Theta needs improvement.

label exp3:
theta: *Points to Letra*
theta: You are Letra. And you are Tenyu, and laying there is Taria.
tyu: He's good now!
theta: ... And outside the door is Cassidy.
lt: !!
tyu: !! How did she find this place?
lt: Tenny, we need to hide Taria.
lt: Cassidy will definitely report her to our ghost organization NUR and they won't let her live.
tyu: We need to hurry.

label exp4:
cd: Tenyu. What are you doing here?
tyu: (Oh no!)
tyu: I... uh...
tyu: (I wish I had Lorale's lying skills.)
tyu: I got a bit lost and wandered into this mansion. Can you show me the way back to NUR?
cd: Sure, after I finish some business here.
tyu: Wha-what do you have to do here?
cd: Reap a dying soul.
tyu: W-wait!

label exp5:
tyu: Ca-cassidy, I am looking for Lorale. Have you seen him?
cd: You know Lorale's at Wielder's HQ performing spy duty.
cd: We are forbidden to interact with him during this time.
tyu: Oh...
lt: Lorale's cover got blown. Tenny needs to go back to tell NUR.
cd: Letra, why are you here too?
lt: I am on a mission for Bill Snow.
lt: Can you show Tenny how to get back to NUR? This is urgent - Lorale's life depends on it.
cd: I'm on a mission.
lt: For?
cd: Roland Snow.
lt: Roland isn't here. He lives in Westwood now.
cd: ... How do you know that?
lt: He's Bill Snow's son. I researched my patron.
cd: Ugh fine. I'll take Tenyu back.
tyu: Thanks.
lt: (I hope I will be okay on my own.)

label exp6:
lt: That was very risky.
lt: I scanned myself there but with no monitor, anyone could have gone in and unplugged me.
lt: I should wait until Tenny or Lorale comes back...
ll: What's going on? Why's Taria so pale?
lt: Lorale. Taria is dying. A ghost, wielder, or monster - I don't know what- stabbed her.
ll: !!
ll: No... no way. We need to save her fast.
ll: Are we using cybertization? I'll go in.

label exp7:
ll: It's almost morning. Does her family know?
ll: We have to finish before they hold her funeral.
lt: No, I don't want Taria to wake up buried alive either.
lt: Her brothers rarely come home, but her Grandma just entered in the hospital in Irondale.
lt: She's in critical condition too, so Taria's parents are with them now.
lt: Irondale is a 3-day plane ride from here, so we have 3 days.
ll: Taria... hang in there.
