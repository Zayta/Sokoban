Why in NUR:
I died because it wouldn't make a difference if I disappeared. I did not have any friends or anyone who needed me. I was invisible most of the time anyways. I felt like I was a boring unlikeable person. No one stayed with me. I tried hard to make myself interesting, but I am ultimately too boring of a person for anyone. I felt lonely.

Xenyu's thoughts about others:

Lorale:

When I first met him, I thought he pitied me. He was one of those who seemed to have a lot of friends, not someone I could relate to. I don't remember when I started talking to him, but he used to say the saddest things and wrapped them up in a joke. That was when I found out that he was sad and lonely like me. I started connecting with him. He became my best friend.
