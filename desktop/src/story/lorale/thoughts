Also I feel now that my concept of replacement is really messed up because I examined the bonds between me and each of my friends, and I thought about what it would be like if any one of them were gone. It wouldn't be the same. I have something unique with every one of them. Everyone has a different vibe, and that was the reason I couldn't find anyone just like my best friend back home on my college campus. I can't ever find other person just like another person anywhere I go. Each relationship is unique, and I think that's also the reason why I talk differently depending on who I talk to.

Sometimes I felt like it was just fakeness- that it was me who had multiple personalities to appeal to different people, and I couldn't settle my own internal differences. To someone, I was a mentor figure and someone who respects all her opinions. To another, I was someone hardworking and smart, who tries hard at school and works for all answers. To a group, I was a shy quiet kid who didn't talk much and seemed to nerd all the time. To someone else, I was a popular kid who had lots of friends and got answers from other people. To my friends back home, I was someone awkward and generous and didn't care much for beauty. I thought I was someone different to each of them. However I guess I wasn't fake or had divided personalities. I only have one personality that shows different sides depending on who I was talking to. It might be the same for them.
Sometimes I felt insignificant because I think that even if I am gone, people will just be as happy.

I used to think that there are always people who can replace me. I thought that some of my friends hung around me because they thought I was smart, but I was afraid they would leave me when they found out how dumb I was, or they found someone else smarter. I thought other friends hung around me because they had no one else to hang with, but as soon as they met someone more fun or interesting, they would leave me. I was scared of being alone.

I guess I was being really self-centered. It was always me that I was worried about. I was scared that I would be abandoned instead of feeling happy for my friends who would be enjoying the company of other people. I was sad about me being replaced when I should be glad that my friends and people close to me won't feel lonely.

I think I am an awful, undeserving person, so I want to become someone better. I want to become mentally strong, someone who can celebrate others and be happy that others are happy. I think this kind of trait is more valuable than being smart, wealthy, famous, popular, or any other things people typically desire.
