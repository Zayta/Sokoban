Sometimes I say things out of pride and end up hating myself for it later. I feel like I should be more considerate of others, so I shouldn't reveal any of my accomplishments. This stupid boastful side of me makes me hate myself and makes me think that others will hate me. 

Other times I am scared to ask for help also due to pride because I worry I will appear stupid. Also due to stupid pride. This year I have been working on that a lot more by marketing myself as stupid, and asking for help left and right. I find that this lifestyle is more enjoyable even though I am a clueless coward.

However I am happiest when I can help others, so I am sometimes hesitant to show myself as clueless coward because people won't trust me to help them. I guess I am just really confused about how I present myself.

After reflecting some time, I think I will not care about how others see me and just go with who I am. If I am clueless I will ask for help, and if I can help others, I will help. I will always just try my best, either for my own work or for the sake of others. I feel a lot more comfortable if I don't worry about how others see me.

Someone said I had "god-tier learning abilities" while to someone else I am the dumbest person on earth. Some people believe I am smart while others see me as completely dumb. I guess I can be a combination of both, though I see myself as dumber than smart. Still, I will try my best in everything I do and I can't control how others see me.
