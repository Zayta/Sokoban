# NUR 
### *Would you ever wish for immortality?*
NUR is an organization that strives to build an afterlife for humans. It consists of *Nighters*, half-dead souls. When people who die without anyone knowing in certain areas of the world, they are offered life-extension iff they gather enough essence from the Essence Lab, which is NUR's screening process for selection of Nighters.  
## Essence Lab

The game centers around various half-dead souls in the Essence Lab. Your goal is to help at least three souls gather enough essence from the lab. 

## Entities
* Souls - have essence requirement/capacity, and color (Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, black). If essence<=0 or essence>capacity, soul disappears.
* Essence - the "HP" for a soul
* Monsters - damage souls by removing essence from them.
* Blocks: hinder movement
  * Moveable Blocks - Blocks that can be pushed. They also act as keys for essence.
    * Colored movable blocks - blocks that can only be pushed by souls of its color
  * Immovable Blocks - Blocks that have fixed position
  * Moving Blocks - Blocks that continuously move in a pattern around a fixed point.
* Items
  * Bombs - used to destroy a block

## Gameplay
Goal is to help at least three souls gather enough essence from the lab.
Every soul has a different essence requirement. Essence unlocks when a block is moved to a region of its color. 
Each essence has a value. The total value of all essence a soul collects must not exceed the soul's capacity. A soul may collect white essence or an essence of its own color.
