## Story
### *Would you want for someone to live your life for you?*
Once upon a time, there was a fairy who wanted people to be happy. Because people seemed happiest when their wishes were granted, she did her best to grant people's desires using her only power in the human world: possession.

If they wallowed, "I wish someone would make me rich", the fairy would go into their body and pilot their life until they become rich. If they wallowed, "I want friends", the fairy would pilot them and make friends for them. She granted any and all wishes to her selected targets. 

However, her identity must remain secret, and therefore she signed contracts with every patron she had. She would possess their body and help them obtain their dream lives, and when she gave them their bodies back, they must never reveal her identity or else they would face instant death. Hence, no one talked about her and only those whom she helped knew about her. 
### Lab of Styx
While she is in possession of the bodies, the souls of those bodies wait inside the Lab of Styx. This is a laboratory located near the river Styx, the line between the living and the dead. The Undertaker, one of the leaders of NUR whose job is to guide dead souls to the underworld, watches over it. Because of the fairy's activities, his laire was flooded with souls who did not need to be transported. As a result, he was furious.
