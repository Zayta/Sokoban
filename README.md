#NUR_Nighters
###*Would you ever wish for immortality?*
NUR is an organization that strives to build an afterlife for humans. It consists of Nighters, half-dead souls. When people who die without anyone knowing in certain areas of the world, they are offered life-extension iff they gather enough essence from the Essence Lab, which is NUR's screening process for selection of Nighters.

# NUR_Exchange
Once upon a time, there was a fairy who wanted people to be happy. She empathized with suffering souls, and wanted to make their lives better. To each soul she heard and believed trustworthy, she offered to help them by using her only power in the human world: possession.

If they wallowed, "I wish someone would make me rich", the fairy would go into their body and pilot their life until they become rich. If they wallowed, "I want friends", the fairy would pilot them and make friends for them. She granted any and all wishes.

However, her identity must remain secret, and therefore she signed contracts with every patron she had. She would possess their body and help them obtain their dream lives, and when she gave them their bodies back, they must never reveal her identity or else they would face instant death. Hence, no one talked about her and only those whom she helped knew about her. 
### Essence Lab
While she is in possession of the bodies, the souls of those bodies wait inside NUR's Essence Lab. The Undertaker watches over it. Because of the fairy's activities, the Essence Lab has been flooded with souls who did not belong. The overpopulation of the Essence Lab has made it difficult for the Undertaker, and as a result he was furious.  

### How to Stay Alive in the Essence Lab
