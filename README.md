### The Fairy Who Wanted to Bring Happiness
Once upon a time, there was a fairy who wanted people to be happy. She empathized with suffering souls, and wanted to make their lives better. To each soul she heard and believed trustworthy, she tried to grant their wishes. If they wallowed, "I wish someone would make me rich", the fairy would go into their body and pilot their life until they become rich. If they wallowed, "I want friends", the fairy would pilot them and make friends for them. She offered to help them by using her only power in the human world: possession.

However, she had a few limits to her heroic acts. First, she could only possess seven souls simultaneously. Second is that her identity must remain secret, and therefore she signed contracts with every patron she had. She would possess their body and help them obtain their dream lives, and when she gave them their bodies back, they must never reveal her identity or else they would face instant death. Hence, no one talked about her and only those whom she helped knew about her. 

### Sudden Deaths
While she is in possession of the bodies, the souls of those bodies wait inside her tower. Oddly, however, most of the people whose bodies she has possessed end up dying either before the end of the contract or soon afterwards.

The exhausted Undertaker, whose job was to escort dead souls to the Underworld, discovered the fairy's activities were the reason for his overloaded work. As he investigated, he located where she kept the souls whose bodies she possessed. Using his feeble power, he sent his specter to her chambers one day.

### Lorale
On the day that the Undertaker sent his specter, a boy named Lorale was in the tower. "Lorale, you have been fooled by the fairy. She won't give you body back to you. You will die if you do not go claim your body back from her."

At first, Lorale didn't care. "It's okay. I'll just die."
The Undertaker, stunned at his response, wondered why such a soul accepted the fairy's offer. Then, after looking at Lorale's profile, the Undertaker said, "You're afraid of fire, aren't you? If you do not evacuate every soul from her tower, I will burn you!"

Lorale had a deep fear of fire, for reasons he couldn't explain. Therefore he agreed to help the Undertaker.
