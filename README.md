"# NUR_Nighters_Gdx"

The NUR Series written in libGDX.

The story starts with Lorale, an ageless boy who grew up as a lab experiment in an unknown facility. After being released from the lab and into society, Lorale suspects that the lab has taken the part of him that allows him to experience emotions. The only thing he seems to feel is blankness. 

When he first entered society, he was in the coastal city of Irondale. He saw people walking around who looked like him and his "brothers" back in the lab. He was prepared a home in a den in the corner of the city. He thought he was happy. Gradually, however, his world turned greyscale, and he realized he had no purpose in life. No family, no friends, no dreams. He felt like a walking corpse. 

To find out what was missing from him, he researched in the library for a week. He learned about something called X-ray scanning, and how it can reveal your insides down your bones. Inspired, he embarked on a quest to earn money for an X-Ray scan. However, X-Ray scans were expensive, and he worked minimum wage jobs. He asked several passerbys while walking around the city, and few coworkers at his various part time jobs about what they think about his aimlessness, and he had several replies assuring that there was nothing wrong with him.
"You are normal."
"Why are you working then?"
"People feel empty all the time. It doesnâ€™t mean your soul is missing."
"The fact that you are worried something might be wrong means you can feel."
"I feel that way too; I think nothing is worth caring for."

Nearly two weeks after the beginning of his quest, Lorale lost his motivation again. People said there was nothing wrong with him, so he gave up. 
For the following months, he copied people. When most people smiled, he smiled. When most people cried, he frowned. He tagged along in social events, although he never said much. He did not have enough experience in anything to talk. 

One day, he got into a car accident. Someone nearby called an ambulance. A doctor performed surgery on him. He found that Lorale had a few prosthetic limbs and no heart. 
"This hole doesn't look like it was from the accident."
"Where did that body part go? Did he choke it out?"

The surgeon did not finish the surgery and declared him dead. As soon as he did, Lorale woke up.
The surgeon was terrified.
"How are you alive right now?"
