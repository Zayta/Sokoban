The repository has some code files that are not used in the actual game that was finalized. 
These include the several mechanisms I experimented with while making my first game from scratch.
I tried implementing a regular stone gathering (non-moving objects that you can collect), 
then spirit system (moving objects that you collect), then movable blocks (objects that you can move), and moving blocks (that move by themselves, but when they collide with player, they move the opposite direction from the player)
before finally settling on color-change. My biggest challenge was the movable blocks system, as figuring out how to get the player to push the block and the block to push other blocks was a 
hard mechanic to figure out, and the system I came up with was very laggy and did not work as intended.
